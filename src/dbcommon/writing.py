TODO: DLI MI Team: Create a 'writing' module similar to the reading module which
      provides the capability to either:

      1. INSERT,
      2. UPDATE, or
      3. DELETE

      from any of the database tables. (You all have write access.) Also be sure to
      use the DBConnect context manager to improve safety.

Look here for any tips:
